# Trainer instructions

### Preparation

As for any workshop or training session, try to be in the room 15 to 20 minutes before the workshop starts. This is especially true if it is your first time facilitating the workshop, or working in this room.
- This way you can make sure that all the table are placed correctly,
- you can test if the beamer / TV works,
- verify that there are enough power-sockets (of extension cords)
- are there any snacks provided


The ideal layout for this workshop is to have a large room with space for a circle of 22 chairs and one big table, with one computer per two participants.
I advise to let the participants pair, this way you can create more discussions. You don't have to, it's an advise.
If you don't know how Pair Programming works, I recommend the following [PairProgramming workshop](https://leanpub.com/pairprogrammingworkshop) from [Yves Hanoulle](http://www.hanoulle.be).
Create a circle of 20 chairs, plus chairs for both trainers (we strongly advise you to coach this workshop with two trainers). You will use this circle to start the workshop, explain everything and also to hold the feedback round.

Next to that circle, you have a large table with 10 computers (next to your own). You can work with the developers' own normal computer setup, but we have noticed that having everyone in the same room and even at the same table, works better for the sharing of knowledge.


+ Have a printed copy of this document for each trainer.
+ Put a timer clock in front of you, you can also use a hourglass.

We have suggested default times for each of the different parts (see "Process and Timetable"). Use these timings as a guideline. If you notice that you are not following the timings, make sure you make a note of how much time you use for each section; It will give you some insight on how to adjust the workshop (we use it like a non graphical burndown).

Keep the introduction brief - just introduce some key concepts, and encourage the participants to introduce themselves. Here is a suggestion for concepts you can very briefly discuss, but remember these can be discussed in more depth during the feedback session at the end:
    What
    Why
    Resistance
    When
    How
    Smells
After the introduction, jump straight into the short exercises. Each pair/person is given fifteen minutes per exercise. At the end of each exercise, people should find a new partner. During these exercises, you can circulate and help people to spot and address common problems (keyboard hogging, etc).

**Little things in the preparation that make our life easier:**

+ While you are facilitating the workshop, when you check the time and notice you're on track, you put a yellow index card in front of both of you.
+ If you're behind schedule, put a red card in front of you.
+ If you're ahead of schedule, use the green index card.

This is a visual management trick - it enhances communication between the two trainers without the need to talk (although during this workshop you have plenty of time to talk to each other).

When people come in, ask each one to write their name on a name badge and put it on their body (stickers are preferable, as they stay visible and easy to read). People will switch partners all the time, so noting their name linked to their location won't help you.

**Tips for first time presenters:**

Three hours is a lot; you might be tempted to trim the workshop. Especially on the feedback round. Don't. The feedback round is the most important part of the workshop.

If you don't have three hours, select another workshop (or contact us, see the contact page to find out how).
