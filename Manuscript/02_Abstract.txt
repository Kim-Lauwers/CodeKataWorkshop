### Description


How do you get to be a great martial artist? It helps to know the theory, and to understand the mechanics of the human body. It helps to have talent. But ultimately, greatness comes from practicing; applying the theory over and over again, using feedback to get better every time.
But in the software industry we take developers trained in the theory and throw them straight in to the deep-end, working on a project.
It’s like taking a group of fit kids and telling them that they a sprint (2 weeks) to beat the World Champion Judo.
In software we do our practicing on the job, and that’s why we make mistakes on the job.
We need to find ways of splitting the practice from the profession. We need practice sessions.

This workshop will give people to practice their skills.

Your colleagues, your team, your boss and your future self will be very happy with your new nice, clean code.
